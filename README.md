# Candidate Instructions

The technical interview will assess your skills in SQL and Python using realistic data.

We will use GitHub Codespaces to provide a live shared VSCode-like coding environment that opens in your browser. At the start of the meeting, we will share a link for you to access this environment.

There will be one challenge for SQL and one for Python, both hosted in Jupyter notebooks.

4. Press Enter to accept the generic sign-in name.
5. Navigate to `notebooks/sql-test.sql` to begin the first challenge.
